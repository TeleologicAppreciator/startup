> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted to test your stock market intuition? At Stock Sprint, every day users receive virtual currency to invest in stocks at the marketâ€™s opening price and automatically sell at the end of the day. Compete with other participants and climb the leaderboard to see who has the best market instincts.

### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Look up opening market stock prices
- Daily leaderboard and all time leaderboard

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Two HTML pages for application, one for login, and one for overview functionality
- **CSS** - Good application styling that looks good on different screen sizes. Uses good whitespace, color choice, and contrast.
- **React** - Provides login, ability to "buy" stocks, displaying the leaderboard, backend endpoint calls. Single page application with component views and reactive to user's actions.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
                - Login
                - Buying stocks
                - Updating leaderboard
- **DB/Login** - Store authenticated information, users, what stocks they bought, leaderboard information.
- **WebSocket** - Sends real-time notifications to connected clients when daily leaderboard updates are posted.
